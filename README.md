## 📖 Overview

**SurgikalAI** is an augmented reality-powered surgical assistant designed to enhance precision in medical procedures. By overlaying real-time 3D visualizations of patient data and integrating machine learning models for tumor detection, SurgikalAI empowers surgeons with cutting-edge tools for decision-making and surgical planning.

## 🚀 Inspiration

Modern surgeries require accuracy, efficiency, and rapid access to critical data. We were inspired by the potential of augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve these factors and reshape the future of surgery. With SurgikalAI, our vision was to enable surgeons to visualize patient data in real-time, reducing human error and improving patient outcomes.

## 🎯 What it does

- **3D Patient Data Visualization:** Real-time AR projection of patient anatomy, including organs, blood vessels, and more.
- **Tumor Detection:** AI-powered model detects tumors and highlights them for the surgeon to view in the AR overlay.
- **Interactive Surgical Planning:** Surgeons can manipulate the AR projections to plan surgical procedures.
- **Training Mode:** An educational tool for training surgeons with interactive procedures and AI-guided feedback.

## 🛠 How we built it

- **AR/VR Framework:** Unity3D + Vuforia for seamless AR integration.
- **AI Model:** Trained using TensorFlow for tumor detection and segmentation.
- **Backend:** Node.js for managing data, integrated with MongoDB.
- **Frontend:** React.js and WebXR for AR interface on HoloLens.
- **APIs:** DICOM data handling through Python for medical imaging.

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges we faced

- **Data Processing:** Handling real-time DICOM medical data and ensuring smooth AR projection.
- **AI Training:** Creating a robust AI model that detects tumors accurately in a wide variety of cases.
- **AR Calibration:** Aligning AR projections perfectly with the surgeon's real-world view.

## 🎉 Accomplishments we're proud of

- Achieved real-time, stable AR visualization of 3D patient data.
- Integrated an AI tumor detection model with 90% accuracy in real-world tests.
- Built an intuitive interface that allows surgeons to interact with AR projections hands-free.

## 📚 What we learned

- The potential of AR in medical applications is immense, especially when combined with AI.
- Balancing accuracy and performance in real-time medical applications requires careful optimization.
- User experience is crucial in medical tech—AR needs to be intuitive and non-intrusive.

## 🔮 What's next for SurgikalAI

- **Expanded AI Models:** Include additional models for different types of tumors and other medical conditions.
- **Advanced AR Features:** Enable collaboration between multiple surgeons through shared AR interfaces.
- **Commercial Deployment:** Partner with hospitals to pilot the system in real-world surgeries.

## 🛠 Built With

- **Languages/Frameworks:** Python, JavaScript (Node.js, React.js), TensorFlow, Unity3D
- **APIs:** WebXR, MongoDB, DICOM
